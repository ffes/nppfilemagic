Unit Tests
==========

This project uses the [Catch2 Test Framework](https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2).

For integration in Visual Studio the [Catch2 Test Explorer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=JohnnyHendriks.ext01) is available as an extension.
It is documented on the [project page of that extension](https://github.com/JohnnyHendriks/TestAdapter_Catch2).
